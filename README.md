# easy-i18n-translation
Like a lot of things, this started as a need for a small, fast and flexible JavaScript i18n translation module that would co-exist with current HTML without breaking anything and a couple of extra requirements.

There's an index.html with some easy examples that also shows off some of the more specific requirements I needed such as:
- the ability to give me a list of translations that need to be provided
- filtering by class
- the ability to do language independant comparisons
